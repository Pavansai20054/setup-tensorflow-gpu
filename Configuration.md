# üöÄ Complete Guide: Setting Up TensorFlow 2.10 with GPU Support

This comprehensive guide will help you configure and set up your NVIDIA GPU to work with TensorFlow 2.10, enabling accelerated deep learning performance.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python** ‚â§ 3.10 (**3.10 recommended**)
- **TensorFlow** 2.10.0

## üîß Installation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install NVIDIA GPU Driver

- Go to [NVIDIA Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)
- Select your GPU category, series, and specific model
- Select your operating system
- Keep language as English (US)
- Click **Find**
- You'll see two driver options:
  - **GeForce Game Ready Driver** (recommended)
  - **NVIDIA Studio Driver**  
- Click **Download** and run the installer (default settings are usually fine)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Anaconda

- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Choose the appropriate installer for your OS and follow the instructions

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8

- Download from [CUDA Toolkit 11.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
- Select your OS, architecture, and distribution
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install cuDNN 8.6

- Visit [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (requires free NVIDIA account)
- Download **cuDNN v8.6.0** for CUDA 11.x
- Extract the downloaded zip file

**Copy files to your CUDA installation directory:**

#### For **Windows**:

- Copy files from the extracted `bin` folder to:  
  `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`
- Copy files from the `include` folder to:  
  `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\include`
- Copy files from the `lib\x64` folder to:  
  `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\lib\x64`

#### For **Linux**:

```bash
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Environment Variables (Windows)

- Search for **"Environment Variables"** in the Start menu
- Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**
- In the System Properties window, click **"Environment Variables"**
- Under **"System Variables,"** verify that `CUDA_PATH` and `CUDA_PATH_V11_8` exist  
  (If not, you may need to reinstall the CUDA Toolkit)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a TensorFlow GPU Environment

Open **Anaconda Prompt** or terminal and run:

```bash
# Create a new environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n "tf2.10-gpu" python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate tf2.10-gpu

# Install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN through conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0

# Install TensorFlow 2.10.0
python -m pip install "tensorflow==2.10.0"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verify GPU Setup

After installation, verify that TensorFlow can detect your GPU:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

If properly set up, this should display a list containing your GPU device(s):

```
[PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]
```

---

## üîÑ Common Troubleshooting Tips

### GPU not detected?
- Ensure your GPU is CUDA-compatible
- Verify that NVIDIA drivers are properly installed
- Check compatibility between TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN versions

### CUDA errors when running TensorFlow?
- Make sure environment variables are correctly set
- Try restarting your computer after installation
- Verify that there are no conflicts with other CUDA installations

### Out of Memory errors?
- Reduce batch size in your TensorFlow models
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Consider using mixed precision training (`tf.keras.mixed_precision`)

## üí° Pro Tip: Enable Memory Growth

If you're working with larger models or datasets, consider using TensorFlow's built-in memory growth option to avoid memory allocation issues:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)
```
